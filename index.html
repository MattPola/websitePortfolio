    <h3>About Me!</h3>
    <p>I am a student at North Idaho College and I am currently studying Computer Science. I have worked on
        quite a few projects at my time here. The most notable one was recreating the popular game
        Five Nights at Freddy's. I have also created a program parser as well as created a TicTacToe game
        that is played over a server. I hope to go into software engineering at some point.
